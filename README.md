# 💰 Budget Management App

This project is a **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that I created as part of my personal learning journey. The goal of this project is to:

- Refresh my full-stack development skills
- Learn more about building full-stack applications using the MERN stack
