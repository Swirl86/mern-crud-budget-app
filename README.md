# Budget Management App

This project is a **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that I created as part of my personal learning journey. The goal of this project is to:

- Refresh my full-stack development skills
- Learn more about building full-stack applications using the MERN stack
- Deepen my understanding of **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive designs

The app will allow users to manage their personal budget by adding, viewing, and deleting transactions while keeping track of their income and expenses.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Future Planned Features
- Add categories to transactions (e.g., groceries, entertainment, etc.)
- Edit and update transactions
- Add authentication and authorization (user login and registration)
- Implement user-specific budgets and spending limits
- Create reports and charts for financial analysis
- Integrate with external APIs for transaction imports (e.g., bank statements)
- Improve UI/UX with a more advanced design and animations
