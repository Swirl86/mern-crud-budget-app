# 💰 Budget Management App

This is a full-stack budgeting application built with the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) as part of my personal learning journey. The app helps users manage their personal finances by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting budget rows for income, expenses, and savings.

## 🎯 My Goals with this project
- Refresh and strengthen my full-stack development skills
- Gain deeper knowledge of building full-stack applications using the MERN stack
- Improve UI design skills with modern, responsive styling using Tailwind CSS


## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Drag-and-Drop**: react-beautiful-dnd
